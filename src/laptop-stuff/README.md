# laptop-stuff
This project has mostly small scripts that are binded to some shortcuts in my
DE. They can be used on either laptops or desktops but the focus is more on
the laptop side.

## Requierements
Each small script has its own requirements. Each one of them is listed in the
table below:

| Script      | Dependencies          |
