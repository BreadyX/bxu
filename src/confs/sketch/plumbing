SNAPSHOT LAYOUT:
	Compressed archive with 2 files:
		1. 'data': contains date and time + diff
		2. file

DB LAYOUT:
	Each nick has his own directory. In the directory reside the snapshots. Each
	snapshot has the hash of its corresponding file as its filename.
	The directory also contains a 'history' file containing an ordered list of
	each snapshot (oldest first).
	Example:
	db_dir
	\- file1
	| \- history
	| \- [ snapshots... ]
	\- file2
		- history
		- [ snapshots... ]
