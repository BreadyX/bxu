# *B*ready*X*'s *U*tilities (BXU)
The BXUs are some small scrips that I have written to make my life in Arch Linux a little easier.

These are **simple utilities** and will never be something very complex. Their main goal is to automate repetitive tasks of varoius nature (system maintenance etc...)

## Requirements:

- Arch Linux
- Flatpak

## Installation
It is advised to install these utilities in the user's private bin folder and not system-wide: install in either `$HOME/.local/bin/` or `$HOME/bin` depending on your configuration and preference.
