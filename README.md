# *B*ready*X*'s *U*tilities (BXU)
The BXUs are some small scrips (mostly bash) that I have written to make my life in Arch Linux a little easier.

These are **simple utilities** and will never be something very complex. Their main goal is to automate repetitive tasks of varoius nature (system maintenance etc...).

## Requirements:

- Arch Linux
	- pacman ( even though it should be obvious)
	- pacman-contrib
- Flatpak (optional)
- Snap (optional)
- git
- bash

## Installation
It is advised to install these utilities in the user's private bin folder and not system-wide: install in either `$HOME/.local/bin/` or `$HOME/bin` depending on your configuration and preference.

**NOTE:** The files inside the `deprecated` folder are either very old and unused scripts or contain some major flaws. When installing, please remove that directory from your installation.
